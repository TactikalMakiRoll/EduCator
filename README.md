## Info on the project

Could've done much better, but I felt sick so there is a lot of room for improvement. Starting from most important things

### Course View

- show correct images when there is no video for lessons
- improve the overall view of the page
- implement PiP and speed change via keyboard events
- save video progress to localStorage

### Other things

- better API error handling and possibility to try to load things again
- add tests to the code
- Video loading animation with progress bar

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
